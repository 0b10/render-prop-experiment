# Summary

A project that makes heavy use of render props in an attempt to minimise coupling between components.
This project mimics a simple blog. For now, it's very basic.

# Concepts

All concepts used to reduce coupling:

* Render props
* The Flux architecture
* A separate model

The goal here is to make each component reusable, and not to focus on features, or pretty styling.

# Responsiveness

An attempt is made to make the app responsive. Only styled-components are used - no other CSS frameworks; all of the CSS is written by manually.
